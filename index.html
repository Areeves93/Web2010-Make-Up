                <p>A just-released study looks at how new in-car technology is taking our eyes off the road. Consumer Reports
                    focuses on vehicle "infotainment systems," including touch screens and controllers on the dashboard.
                    Acura, Cadillac, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla and Volvo are all rated as having the most distracting systems.
                    Eight other car makers, including Ford, GM and Fiat-Chrysler, are rated as having the least. In Washington,
                    distracted driving gets a rebrand as DUI-EAAA: High tech dashboards leading to distracted driving While
                    some of the technology may make it easier to adjust things like the temperature or the radio, Consumer
                    Reports says replacing classic knobs and buttons with digital screens can make things confusing and more
                    distracting for drivers, reports CBS News correspondent Don Dahler. "Casey's last words were 'I want
                    my mom,'" said Joel Feldman who lost his 21-year-old daughter, Casey, to a distracted driver in 2009.
                    The aspiring reporter was struck walking across the street as the driver of a van was reaching for his
                    GPS.

                    <p>The coal industry has lost more than 40 percent of its workforce in recent years. Out-of-work miners
                        have had to find jobs in other fields. Former miners are heading to the classroom, using many of
                        the same skills they used underground. In Boone County, West Virginia, coal mining has provided work
                        for seven generations of Billy Jack Buzzard's family. He became a miner when he was 18, right after
                        graduating high school.

                        <p>Jessie Bardwell, 27, a beloved daughter and friend seemingly vanished from the Texas home she shared
                            with her boyfriend, Jason Lowe. Fearing the worst, her father traveled from Mississippi to Texas
                            to start the search for his daughter. Jessie's body was later found in a remote spot of farmland
                            wrapped in a sheet. Police suspected murder, but was it? "This story is about a young girl,"
                            Richardson, Texas. Detective Eric Willadsen tells "48 Hours" correspondent Maureen Maher. "Thinks
                            she finds love and it turns out he's pure evil." Jessie was fun-loving and outgoing, say friends
                            and family. She lived in Orange Beach, Ala., where she worked at a local hotspot.

                                movement as it shifted from violence to peace, announced Saturday that he was stepping down
                                as leader of Sinn Fein next year after heading the party for over 30 years. The 69-year-old

                                1983 - told the party's annual conference in Dublin he would not run in the next Irish parliamentary

                                of leadership transition within the party. A divisive figure, some have denounced Adams as
                                a terrorist while others hail him as a peacemaker. In 2015, he told CBS News' Scott Pelley

                                        with approximately 50 very attractive females" during his life and mentioned several
                                        encounters, including one in a hayloft of her parents' barn.
