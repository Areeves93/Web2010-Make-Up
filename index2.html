                                    <p>A just-released study looks at how new in-car technology is taking our eyes off the road. Consumer Reports focuses on vehicle "infotainment systems," including touch screens and controllers on the dashboard.
                                            
                                            Acura, Cadillac, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla and Volvo are all rated as having the most distracting systems. Eight other car makers, including Ford, GM and Fiat-Chrysler, are rated as having the least.

                                            "Casey's last words were 'I want my mom,'" said Joel Feldman who lost his 21-year-old daughter, Casey, to a distracted driver in 2009.

                                        <p>The coal industry has lost more than 40 percent of its workforce in recent years. Out-of-work miners have had to find jobs in other fields. 
                                                
                                                Former miners are heading to the classroom, using many of the same skills they used underground. 
                                                
                                                In Boone County, West Virginia, coal mining has provided work for seven generations of Billy Jack Buzzard's family. He became a miner when he was 18, right after graduating high school. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/out-of-work-coal-miners-find-new-work-in-computer-industry/" target="_parent"> ...Read Article</a></p>
